# Looking for coincidences 

This is an app I created to make funnier an exercise we had to do for Educacion IT bootcamp (Exercise 7).

## Primary objective

Main objective for me was to code using AJAX and callbacks to get to a good understanding of both.  

## What does this APP do? 

1. It shows the instructions as they had been given to us (although the app is more complex and has more automation than they requested). 
2. User chooses the number of people to incorporate (comparison is not only made with two people. It can be done with the number of people user wants to. 
3. Instructions requested that matches be done among all the names and surnames. I decided to separate between names on the one hand and surnames on the other. So the app first searches if there are matches in names, then asks if user wants to see the matches in surnames and if answer is "si", app looks for surnames matches.
